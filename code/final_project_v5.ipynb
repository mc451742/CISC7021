      "An evil dictator controlled a fortress situated in the center of a small country. Many roads radiated out from the fortress like spokes on a wheel. A general raised an army at the border, vowing to capture the fortress and overthrow the dictator. The general was about to send his entire army down one road to capture the fortress, when he learned that the dictator had mined each road so that although small groups could still pass, a large army would set off an explosion. The general then had a clever idea: he divided his army into small groups and dispatched each group to the head of a different road. Upon his signal, each group charged down a different road. All the groups passed safely to the fortress, where the entire army attacked the fortress in full strength. In this way the general captured the fortress and overthrew the dictator.\n",

There is a kind of ray that will destroy the tumor if the rays reach it at a high intensity. But unfortunately, such high-intensity rays will also destroy the healthy tissue they pass through on the way to the tumor. At lower intensities the rays will not damage the healthy tissue, but neither will they remove the tumor. How can the doctor use rays to destroy the tumor, while at the same time sparing the healthy tissue?\n",

A general raised an army at the border, vowing to capture the fortress and overthrow the dictator. The general was about to send his entire army down one road to capture the fortress, when he learned that the dictator had mined each road so that although small groups could still pass, a large army would set off an explosion. The general then had a clever idea: he divided his army into small groups and dispatched each group to the head of a different road. Upon his signal, each group charged down a different road.

In both examples, there are 2 equations and 2 unknowns, but the second example has a simpler solution. In the second example, we know that Alice is 20 years old, so we can substitute her age into the equation and solve for Bob's age.
